## Rendering packages for alternative trees

These are iTOL and FigTree packages, generated in the same way as the reference tree, except for being black & white.

Downloads are provided at [GitHub directory](https://github.com/biocore/wol/tree/master/gallery/alter).

Descriptions of various trees can be found at [data/trees](../../data/trees).

Each tree was annotated using NCBI and GTDB taxonomy. See [data/taxonomy](../../data/taxonomy).
