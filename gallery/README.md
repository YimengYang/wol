Renderings of the phylogenetic trees generated in this project.

Go to [online gallery](https://biocore.github.io/wol/gallery/).

For the reference tree:

- An [**interactive visualization**](../empress.html), powered by our novel massive tree renderer: [Empress](https://github.com/biocore/empress).

- Pre-formated tree and metadata files which can be directly parsed and rendered by [iTOL](https://itol.embl.de/) and [FigTree](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). They were pre-collapsed at class / phylum levels.

- High-resolution PDF images of the pre-formated tree.

For other trees:

- Pre-formated tree and metadata files without coloring.

We also provide the [protocol](../protocols/tree_rendering.md) and [source code](../code/notebooks/render_tree.ipynb) for generating and using the static renderings.
