Prototype Selection
===================

Go to [GitHub directory](https://github.com/biocore/wol/tree/master/code/prototypeSelection).

A new heuristic solution to the prototype selection problem, `destructive_maxdist`, designed and implemented by our team, together with implementations of three other heuristic solutions and one exhaustive solution, are provided in [prototypeSelection.py](prototypeSelection.py).
